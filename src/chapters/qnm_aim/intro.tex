Moving forward with the discussion of quasinormal modes, this section will describe the Asymptotic Iteration Method (\ac{AIM}) and the published implementation of it, the \texttt{QuasinormalModes.jl} Julia package.

The chapter will commence with a portrayal of the equations regulating perturbations of diverse spins on a Schwarzschild background. Subsequently, details of the \ac{AIM} and the construction of \texttt{QuasinormalModes.jl} will be provided. Finally, the results obtained using the package to determine the quasinormal modes of the various spin perturbations established at the start of the chapter will be demonstrated. Each value will be computed utilizing literature values, when possible, and results from an independent implementation of the pseudospectral method for the same problems. Moreover, newly determined frequencies will be reported using the package.
