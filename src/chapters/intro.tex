One of the most well know predictions of the Theory of General Relativity (GR) is the existence of spacetime oscillations that propagate throughout the universe, the so called, gravitational waves. The first (indirect) evidence of the existence of such waves occurred when Hulse and Taylor observed, in 1975, the binary system PSR B1913$+$16~\cite{1975ApJ...195L..51H}. Observational data proved to be compatible with theoretical analysis for neutron star binaries that emit gravitational waves. On the other hand, direct observations, despite being attempted since the 1960s, only became a reality recently in the year 2015, with measurements from the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO)~\cite{grav1,grav2} giving birth to a new era in astronomy and cosmology. These two observations have a common factor: they involve \emph{binary systems}, that is, two astronomical objects that are close enough for their mutual gravitational attraction to cause them to orbit around a common center of mass as they get closer and closer until a catastrophic collision event occurs, releasing huge amounts of energy and angular momentum in the form of gravitational radiation.

So far, no analytic description of a binary system in GR is known. This is due to the extreme complexity of Einstein's equations (a system of 10 coupled non-linear partial differential equations) whose exact solution is known only for very specific systems with a high degree of symmetry. Even if such an exact solution were to be found, it would likely be too large, complicated and impractical to use. Given that in a collision event the nonlinear character of the equations becomes important the problem must be treated numerically, with the techniques of the field of Numerical Relativity (NR).

The main goal of our work is to study certain effects in GR that are well-know to spacetimes containing a single astrophysical object (a star or a black hole), namely the \emph{quasinormal ringdown} and \emph{the Penrose process}, and extend them to binary systems. To that end, we will work on two fronts: The first is a \emph{semi-analytic} approach in which we will study exact (and analytic) solutions of Einstein's field equations that approximate binary black hole systems in static equilibrium. Such solutions allow us to employ well established numerical and semi-analytic techniques in our studies. The second is a \emph{numeric} approach in which we will use non-exact approximations of binary systems that are no longer in static equilibrium for our investigations.
