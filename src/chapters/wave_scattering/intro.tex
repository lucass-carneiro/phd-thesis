Beginning with this chapter, the focus of our work will shift from the Penrose Process to quasinormal modes. Specifically, this chapter will detail numerical simulations of a scalar wave scattered on a merging black hole binary, specifically the binary involved in the GW150914 event. The chapter will cover the construction of the code and the execution of the simulations, as well as preliminary results.

In the upcoming sections, the equations for the evolution of a scalar wave over a numerically evolved metric without back-reaction will be introduced. The spacetime evolution will neglect the scalar field's effect on its stress-energy-momentum tensor. Furthermore, a detailed account of the \texttt{EinsteinToolkit Thorn KleinGordon} responsible for this evolution will be provided, and the results obtained thus far will be presented. The author developed the scalar field evolution code and made it accessible, along with valuable resources, in the \texttt{GitHub} repository mentioned in Ref.~\cite{FieldPerturbationsRepo}.
