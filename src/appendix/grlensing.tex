The code was originally created with the intent of producing Gravitational Lensing images (hence the name) but was later adapted to investigate the PP. The code consists of a \emph{kernel} using the ARKODE~\cite{ARKODE} infrastructure for integrating the geodesic equation and verifying the stopping criteria of Eqs.~\eqref{eq:arbitrary_penrose_background_sphere_cplision_condition} and \eqref{eq:arbitrary_penrose_swallowing_condition} for an arbitrary spacetime metric. The kernel expects only to receive a set of functions that compute the ADM quantities of the spacetime metric (lapse, shift, extrinsic curvature and a few derivatives of these objects). Each spacetime metric is then a \emph{plugin} (a dynamically loaded library) that provides such functions at runtime. This allows the integration problem to be separated from the problem of determining the ADM quantities of a given spacetime metric. Users can focus on the latter, since the kernel solves the former for an arbitrary input metric. In addition to spacetime metrics being plugins, file readers and writers are also plugins in the same way. This allows the user to implement different input/output data formats for the trajectories according to their needs. Currently, only a simple \texttt{ASCII} file writer is available, but that is enough for our current purposes. The behavior of the program is driven at runtime by a command line interface, \texttt{YAML} configuration files and the available dynamic libraries implementing spacetime metrics and writers. A basic configuration file named \texttt{grlensing\_config.yaml} is expected to be present, detailing various ARKODE internal settings, such as error tolerances, max. number of iterations, etc. It also details the metric and file writer plugins to be loaded and made available at runtime as well as settings of the \texttt{dump-metric} command. Additional configuration files are required in certain modes (for instance, describing a certain spacetime parameters and initial conditions of a particle). Through the command line, the user selects the operation mode of the code. At the time of writing, the available modes of operation are (these can be viewed by invoking the program with \texttt{--help})
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{list-plugins}: Lists all the plugins that are set to be loaded (and were found)
  \item \texttt{dump-metric}: Writes a spacetime metric in a cube of arbitrary size and arbitrary number of internal points. This option is used mostly for debugging the implementation of a spacetime metric plugin.
  \item \texttt{integrate-trajectory}: Integrates a single particle trajectory with the specified configurations.
  \item \texttt{penrose-breakup}: Integrates a particle breakup process by using two particle configurations and obtaining a third from conservation of 4-momentum.
\end{itemize}

Several utility scripts are also provided in the program repository under the \texttt{resources} folder. These scripts serve multiple purposes, from plotting trajectories, energies, the ADM quantities of dumped spacetime metrics or even generating a skeleton of a metric plugin that can be filled by users. It also includes an assortment of papers and notes required in the development of the code.
